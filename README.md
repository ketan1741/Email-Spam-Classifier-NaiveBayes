# Email-Spam-Classifier-NaiveBayes

## About the Repo
* Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.

## Algorithm:
* In this project, I will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model.
* It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. 
* Often they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. 
* Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. 
* To the human recipient, it is usually pretty straight forward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!
